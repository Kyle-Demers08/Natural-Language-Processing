The English Football League (EFL) is England’s professional and not professional hierarchy of league structure. At the end of each season a set number of teams go down a league due to their poor performance and are replaced by teams from the lower league who performed the best. This implies that at the top of the EFL, the EPL the teams there are the best, hence more viewership and therefore leading to more advertisement income. 
Unlike most American sports, the culture is that the fans in the English Premier League have a significant amount of power. Controlling most of the clubs’ revenue through TV viewership, ticket sales, club merchandise and more, the fans have the ability to make change within the club through their collective voice. In this season alone 14 Premier League manager have been sacked with only 20 total teams. If owners could understand the sentiment of clubs and appease them early on, this could increase revenue through the club through ticket sales or help the team in general perform better. It’s also important to look at how the performance of the club is reflected by the fans’ sentiment. How do wins draws and losses look for teams in different positions with different objectives, and how does the fan sentiment reflect that?
